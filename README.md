# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview

We have been taksed with determining the patterns of credit risk using a large credit card dataset from LendingClub. We will use several machine learning models to better understand trends withing the data. By creating oversampled, undersampled, and combination sampled machine learing models using different algorithms we hope to compare the results. If the models return similar results, we can assume the models can realiably predict loan risk.
